# Insurance-prediction
It is a Machine Learning project that predicts the approximate insurance cost based upon the features provided for
each individual. It is a Regression problem.
The algorithm used in this peoject is Linear Regression.
Executed the steps like Data preprocessing, Feature selection, Model Building, Evaluation & Tuning. 

The model was build on base linear model, Ridge, LASSO and Elastic Net techniques.
The Ridge technique gave the best results. The Root mean squared error was least in this.
* R-squared: 0.705
* RMSE: 0.487
* Adj R-square: 0.703
